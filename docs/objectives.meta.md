Meta: Objectives and Scope of IPLD
==================================

This document is the first translation to concrete steps after the Vision declarations,
and the root back to which we expect to tie most major features --
almost everything should reasonably trace back to some of the bulletpoints in this document.

This document is **not** intended to be introductory material.
For some audiences, it might still viably serve that purpose;
but it's not the primary goal, and simplified wording is not used in this document.
