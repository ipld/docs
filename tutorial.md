# Thinking in data structures

You're already using many data structures in your programs. Here's
an example.

<CodeSwitcher :languages="{js:'JavaScript',go:'Go',rust:'Rust'}">
<template v-slot:js>

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Mikeal Rogers',
  github: 'mikeal',
  twitter: '@mikeal'
}
```

</template>
<template v-slot:go>

```go
var todo
```

</template>
<template v-slot:rust>

```rust
let todo
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

Let's think about what this really is.

We've taken some strings and we've assigned them to properties.
If we didn't assign them to properties, how would we know what they mean?
We only know what the values mean because we've assigned them to
properties that mean something.

What would it mean if we were to assign a value of `null` to the "twitter"
property? It would mean that person isn't on twitter! Both the value **and** where
we put that value have meaning when applied **together**.

If you pass this data structure to another function, it can tell who this person is
because it contains references to the information about that person. In IPLD,
we would call `person` a **node**, and the properties that person contains references
to would also be **nodes**. If we're talking about everything this person references,
and everything those references might reference, we would call that the person's **graph**.

Now let's build a data structure that captures some relationships between
nodes.

<CodeSwitcher :languages="{js:'JavaScript',go:'Go',rust:'Rust'}">
<template v-slot:js>

```js
const earth = []
const pluto = []

const index = (person, planet) => {
  planet.push(person)
}

index({ name: 'Mikeal Rogers' }, earth)
index({ name: 'Eric Myhre' }, earth)
index({ name: 'Volker Mische' }, earth)
index({ name: 'Emory' }, pluto)
index({ name: 'Oglethorpe'}, pluto)

const galaxy = { earth, pluto }
```

</template>
<template v-slot:go>

```go
var todo
```

</template>
<template v-slot:rust>

```rust
let todo
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

Let's explore our graph of the galaxy. It has two properties, one for each planet
we've decided to index. If I want to see who is on planet earth, I check that property.

I know that Mikeal, Eric, and Volker are all on the same planet not because of a property
*inside* their graph but because of the **structure** of the graph that refers to them.

There's a huge world of data structures out there, some of which you may be familiar with
and some that you may not be familiar with yet. Something you need to keep in mind
as you learn IPLD is that **how you *arrive* at information is often as important, if not more
important, than the information you arrive at**.

## Addressing

Depending on what language you program in, you may be familiar with the concept of a pointer.
If you aren't, it's just a way to reference data in one place while it lives in another place.
URLs are like pointers for The Web, they let you put a reference on one web page to a web page
that could be on the other side of the world.

In IPLD we use a standard called [CID](https://proto.school/#/anatomy-of-a-cid/01)
for linking data together. CID's act like pointers **and** they act like URLs.
They let us safely reference data that might be on the other side of the
internet, or locally in memory, or anywhere else. **This is how we decentralize data structures!**

<CodeSwitcher :languages="{js:'JavaScript',go:'Go',rust:'Rust'}">
<template v-slot:js>

```js
import Block from '@ipld/block/defaults.js'

const example = async () => {
  const person = {
    name: 'Mikeal Rogers',
    github: 'mikeal',
    twitter: '@mikeal'
  }
  const block = Block.encoder(person, 'json')
  const cid = await block.cid()
  console.log(cid.toString())
}
example()
```

</template>
<template v-slot:go>

```go
var todo
```

</template>
<template v-slot:rust>

```rust
let todo
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

Prints
```
bagaaierakbgholyvqnp2kjpr5ep6yh6u4uhop7cv7wvabydbctksletsilkq
```

This is the **address** (CID) of this data.

The first thing to notice about this code is that we didn't *assign* a key to this data. We
encoded the data as `'json'` and then we got the data's address.

A CID tells us two things, it tells us how the data was encoded (`json`) and it tells us the
**hash** of the data. With this identifier, I can store this data anywhere on the internet.
I can then retreive this data from anyone on the internet **without trusting them** ðŸ˜±

Let's look back at a few things we did.

<CodeSwitcher :languages="{js:'JavaScript',go:'Go',rust:'Rust'}">
<template v-slot:js>

```js
const block = Block.encoder(person, 'json')
```

</template>
<template v-slot:go>

```go
var todo
```

</template>
<template v-slot:rust>

```rust
let todo
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

We encode this data using JSON. Now it has been serialized to a binary representation we
can store and/or send to someone else.

<CodeSwitcher :languages="{js:'JavaScript',go:'Go',rust:'Rust'}">
<template v-slot:js>

```js
const cid = await block.cid()
```

</template>
<template v-slot:go>

```go
var todo
```

</template>
<template v-slot:rust>

```rust
let todo
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

Then we're going to do a cryptographic computation on that serialized binary which gives us
a **globally unique** identifier for that binary. The CID tells us "this is JSON data
that matches this **hash**."

We can now ask any random device on the internet "do you have this CID?"

If they say "yes, here's that data" I can receive the data without needing to trust them
because I'm going to compute the hash of that data after I receive it and if it doesn't
match the CID's hash I know they're lying.

Once I have binary data that matches the CID, I know that I need to decode this data with JSON
because the CID told me it was encoded with JSON. When one person sends another person data
this way, the in-memory representations of these data structures are identical on each machine.

It's worth taking a break and considering what this means.

Hashes let anyone exchange **data** around the internet. CID's let anyone exchange **data structures**
around the internet.

# Linking

Here's where things get **really** interesting.

<CodeSwitcher :languages="{js:'JavaScript',go:'Go',rust:'Rust'}">
<template v-slot:js>

```js
const createPerson = name => Block.encoder({ name }, 'json')

const createGalaxy = async () => {
  const mikeal = await createPerson('Mikeal Rogers').cid()
  const eric = await createPerson('Eric Myhre').cid()
  const volker = await createPerson('Volker Mische').cid()
  const elon = await createPerson('Elon Musk').cid()

  const galaxy = {
    americans: [ eric, mikeal, elon ],
    inAmerica: [ mikeal ],
    onEarth: [ mikeal, eric, volker ],
    onMars: [ elon ]
  }
  const block = Block.encoder(galaxy, 'dag-cbor')
  const cid = await block.cid()
  console.log(cid.toString())
}
createGalaxy()
```

</template>
<template v-slot:go>

```go
var todo
```

</template>
<template v-slot:rust>

```rust
let todo
```

</template>
</CodeSwitcher>

Now we have a data structure made of **blocks**. In IPLD, we call each hashed piece of data a **block**.
A block could have one or many nodes *inside that block* (like a large nested JSON object).
Most importantly, it can **link** to other **blocks**.

In the above example, we created a **block** for each person. We then use the CID for each **block**
to reference every person in our index of the galaxy. Note that we can't use JSON to encode the index
of the galaxy and we use `'dag-cbor'` instead. JSON has a strictly defined set of types and our Link
data type (CID) isn't in that set, so we use a *"codec"* the IPLD team wrote called `dag-cbor` because
it knows how to represent links from any CID. You can use `dag-cbor` to encode any data you can
encode with JSON as well as Links (CIDs) to other blocks.

Let's pause for a moment and talk about what this means.

CIDs can be encoded for any existing serialization and **any future** serialization format.
More importantly, a data structure can freely create links *between* these serializations. If you
have JSON data you don't need to change it or re-encode it, you can still create new data structures
that reference that data using links. In addition to `JSON` there are [IPLD codecs for `git`, `bitcoin`,
`zcash`, `ETH`, and more]().

Now, let's move to a new computer and ask the internet for this index of the galaxy we just created.

Once we have the block data we can decode it with `dag-cbor` into an in-memory data structure. We can
traverse it and see all the links to other data.

Before we ask the internet for the data of all the people in the galaxy, what can we say with **only**
this index data? What can we learn from just looking at these hash based links?

```js
{ americans: [ Hash(0003), Hash(0001), Hash(0004) ],
  inAmerica: [ Hash(0001) ],
  onEarth: [ Hash(0001), Hash(0002), Hash(0003) ],
  onMars: [ Hash(0004) ]
}
```

Wow, quite a lot actually:

* There is 1 person in America and they are an American.
* There are 2 Americans that are not in America.
* The person on Mars is an American.
* I know how many people are indexed on each planet.
* There are only 4 unique people in this index.

This is a limited index, with a very limited set, and none of the links have been traversed,
but we know quite a lot already!

Let's pretend that the data about Mars is really on Mars, and the data about earth is on Earth.
So if we want to know "who is on Mars" we'll have to ask for that data from Mars, which is going
to take a while. But what if we want to know "who is **not** on Mars?" To learn that we only
need to request the data we have on our own planet!

Something interesting is happening here.

Everyone who requests the data we just looked at will get the same thing. We're all reading the
same *"state"* of this index of the galaxy. We learn what we want to learn from this index and
we only need to request the parts of the data stucture that are required for us to answer the
questions we have. If this were a typical database it would need **all** the data in order to
provide answers to these questions. We wouldn't be able to distribute the parts of this data
structure to who needs it. We wouldn't be able to build local offline caches, or caches in CDN's,
because the database can't share *part* of its larger global state.

With IPLD, if people on Mars only care about the data about Mars, and people on Earth only care
about data on Earth, they can very efficiently localize the data they access the most.

**This is how we're going to decentralize The Web**, by building data structures we can share
and distribute across The Internet.
